      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="Graphical-Abstract"><a href="#Graphical-Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Graphical Abstract:"></a>Graphical Abstract:</h2><p><img src="/images/Graphical_Abstract.png" alt="Graphical Abstract"></p><hr><span id="more"></span><h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction:"></a>1. Introduction:</h2><p>What is innovation? It’s hard to define it. The reality is that innovation is more than just an idea, more than just a thing, it doesn’t have to be grand all the time, and it doesn’t just happen directly in manufacturing. Innovation may be a combination of the above(PMGT5875 Workshop 1:what is innovation). Among many examples of innovation, the Digital Twin is worth mentioning. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models of physical entities enhancing decision-making through real-time data analysis. Initially aimed at real-time monitoring and simulation, the concept is evolving with growing market value, expected to rise from $8.6 billion in 2022 to $137.67 billion in 2030. Major tech firms are advancing DT applications across various sectors like manufacturing and smart city development for better planning, design, and predictive maintenance, promoting efficiency and failure reduction. This emerging technology continues to unfold, promising a substantial impact on future research and practice.</p><h2 id="2-Background-and-Development"><a href="#2-Background-and-Development" class="headerlink" title="2. Background and Development:"></a>2. Background and Development:</h2><p>The idea of Digital Twins (DTs) started taking shape in 1991, but it was in 2002 when Michael Grieves introduced the term. It got a formal tag through NASA’s John Vickers in 2010, tracing back to NASA’s 1960s space adventures. Fast forward to 2017, with IoT making strides, DTs garnered much attention. Crafting DTs needs a strategic layout, beginning with a basic blueprint, followed by establishing clear governance, and then moving towards step-by-step implementation, all while being enriched by AI. Key players like manufacturers, suppliers, tech firms, and various project stakeholders are integral from production to decision-making stages, highlighting DTs’ growing relevance in today’s engineering and business spheres.</p><h2 id="3-Strategy-Evaluation"><a href="#3-Strategy-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="3. Strategy Evaluation:"></a>3. Strategy Evaluation:</h2><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are steering a new era of operational efficiency and product quality, while fostering impactful R&amp;D, ultimately trimming costs and expediting repair solutions. Yet, they hit a few bumps along the road, especially with ensuring data quality and navigating security pitfalls, not to mention the adoption snags in some scenarios. The market pulse for DTs is strong, with a predicted annual growth spurt of about 60% over the coming half-decade, marking a substantial market valuation, notably so in the healthcare realm. This market vigour, paired with its inherent advantages, underlines the promising horizon of DTs, even in the face of current hurdles. The evolving facade of DTs and their surging market stature hint at a profound imprint on diverse industries, heralding a future filled with wider acceptance and technological strides.</p><h2 id="4-Market-and-Social-Impact"><a href="#4-Market-and-Social-Impact" class="headerlink" title="4. Market and Social Impact:"></a>4. Market and Social Impact:</h2><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are anticipated to see a tenfold market increase in the next half-decade(Curry,2020). As innovation catalysts, they’re revolutionizing sectors by digitally echoing physical entities, aiding comprehensive enterprise transformations. In agriculture, DTs yield unmatched control over physical components. By merging varied technologies, they offer empirical data, refining agricultural practices and boosting decision-making processes (Pylianidis and Osinga et al., 2021). Shifting to smart manufacturing, DTs serve as links between the virtual and tangible realms, particularly in optimizing entire factories. Their support for life cycle management underlines their transformative influence on project management (Jiang and Yin et al., 2021). Concurrently, in healthcare, DTs provide socio-ethical advantages in disease prevention and treatment. Yet, they also introduce challenges, with data privacy being paramount. However, embracing DTs brings challenges. Cybersecurity risks and potential data inaccuracies can affect ROI and risk malicious cyber breaches (Juarez and Botti et al., 2021). As industries incorporate DTs, these considerations remain crucial.</p><h2 id="5-Governance-and-Strategy"><a href="#5-Governance-and-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="5. Governance and Strategy:"></a>5. Governance and Strategy:</h2><p>Digital Twins (DTs) serve as invaluable tools for both managers and policymakers, aiding in fine-tuning operations and fostering well-informed choices. Managers tap into DTs for making on-the-spot decisions, ramping up operational efficacy, and easing the path of change management, thus ensuring actions dovetail with organizational aims. Conversely, policymakers can harness DTs to vividly and transparently portray data-backed policy decisions, scrutinize policy alternatives, and tackle socioeconomic inequities. Although DTs come with a plethora of advantages, sculpting realistic visualizations for policy display demands a rich data reservoir. Additionally, DTs are pivotal in elevating socioeconomic cognizance and employing real-time data in urban planning, illustrating their capacity to meld data analytics with policy crafting. The judicious fusion of DTs within managerial and policymaking corridors can markedly bolster the attainment of both organizational and societal goals, heralding a stride towards a realm of data-centric governance and operational frameworks.</p><h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion:"></a>6. Conclusion:</h2><p>In wrapping up, Digital Twins (DTs), embodying digital mirrors of tangible entities, usher in a revolutionary tactic for bolstering operational prowess, honing decision-making, and tackling societal hurdles. The DTs market is on the cusp of notable expansion, with its tendrils reaching into diverse sectors. The rollout of DTs calls for a well-orchestrated strategy, rallying pivotal players like manufacturers, tech moguls, managers, and policymakers. Despite the bouquet of advantages DTs bring to the table, they’re not without challenges, with cybersecurity and data precision topping the list. The horizon looks bright, with DTs poised to churn out substantial economic value, becoming a staple in myriad sectors. The roadmap ahead suggests a methodical approach to crafting and escalating DTs, aiming for a balanced exploitation of this tech marvel. The multifaceted ripple effect of DTs underscores their indispensable role in today’s digital tapestry, advocating for a collective endeavor among stakeholders to fully seize their potential while keeping the inherent challenges at bay.</p><h2 id="7-References"><a href="#7-References" class="headerlink" title="7.
